## Project Overview
This project is part of the Softtek Academy .NET Project, focusing on the development of a RESTful API using .NET Core 6 and SQL Server 2019. The project also includes a frontend component built with Razor Pages.

## Description
The primary goal of this project is to create a RESTful API for the initial deliverable, and for the second delivery, a user-friendly frontend using Razor Pages for interacting with the API. The API serves as the backend, and the Razor Pages frontend provides a seamless user interface for accessing and managing data from the database.

## Architecture Details
The project consists of different layers:
- Controller Layer: Communicates with the API and serves as the endpoint.
- DataAccess Layer: Includes the DbContext and entity seeders for the database.
- Entities Layer: Declares all entities for the database.
- Repositories Layer: Manages interactions with the database.
- Helper: Contains useful project-specific logic (e.g., password encryption/decryption).
- Interfaces: Declares methods used throughout the project.
- Mapper: Defines mapping classes for entity-DTO or DTO-entity relationships.
